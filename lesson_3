When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I work wit other people, when I want to share my super projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I dont know, that changes made on repository's master barnch are correct to me.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks work between two remotes. I can use it on github without my local repository. Clone just clone the remote repository into my local repository. 
Branches are a labels of commits. They can exist in local and remote repositories.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit is that it sometiems happens that I can make mistakes in my new commit added localy, so I need to compare my commit
with last know state of the remote stored locally.
